The wind turbine is an important component of the renewable energy industry, generating wind power and contributing to the production of green energy. The de-icing process is necessary to ensure the turbine's efficient operation and to prevent damage to the blades. The wind turbine blade is a crucial part of the turbine, and its proper functioning is essential for the overall performance of the wind power industry. The ice adhesion of composite anti-/deicing components is a topic of study to improve the efficiency of the de-icing process. Airborne de-icing solutions for wind turbines have been developed to make the process more effective and efficient. The wind turbine de-icing process is an important aspect of the wind power industry, and it is essential to maintain the turbine's performance to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply"
